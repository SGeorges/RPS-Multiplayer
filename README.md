#### 07-Firebase Assignment

The website starts off as a page with buttons for both sides. Then the user is assigned a status, Player 1, Player 2, or Spectators (This status is only assigned on inital page load and cannot be changed even if the Player 1 or Player 2 slots become available). Player 1 and Player 2 have their respective selection buttons available, Spectator has no buttons available. All users are able to view the statistics or message board.

#### Deliberate Features

The message board retains all of the text, even from existing games played. Only the last 8 messages are viewable. If Player 1 leaves the new person to enter the role of Player 1 will have fresh stats for wins/losses/ties. Player 2 will retain all of their stats until they leave the session. The message board will present your messages in blue and others messages in black. Server messages are presented in green.
